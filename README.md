# Peass-CI sample usage project

This project provides several examples for the usage of the [Peass-CI-Plugin](https://github.com/DaGeRe/peass-ci). 

## Overview
This project demonstrates the usage of the [Peass-CI-Plugin](https://github.com/DaGeRe/peass-ci) on a Jenkins server. The plugin can be used to detect performance differences and their potentially causes between different versions of a Java project. Therefore, the Jenkins server executes a pipeline-build of the Java project, measuring its performance.
Each example uses the *demo-project* as testproject. The *demo-project* can be found as a tar-file inside the *common*-folder.

## General Approach
All examples run Jenkins inside a Docker container. Scripts are provided to build/configure and start the container(s). Also a Jenkins pipeline-job is configured by copying a *config.xml* to its appropriate folder in Jenkins. The *config.xml* defines the jobs pipeline in which the parameters of the performance measurements are set.

The YAML-files in *.github/workflows* configure jobs to be built on github-actions with Java 8, 11 and 15.

There exist six jobs:

* buildOnController

* buildOnControllerDevelop

* buildOnJenkinsStartedAgent

* buildOnJenkinsStartedAgentDevelop

* buildOnManuallyStartedAgent

* buildOnManuallyStartedAgentDevelop

So each example is built on github, respectively using the main- and develop-branches of *Peass* and *Peass-CI*.

## Important
Each example has its own folder. Make sure to always run the appropriate scripts from the appropriate folder!

To build the latest version of *Peass-CI*, execute *buildPeassAndPeassCI.sh* in common/scripts. This will install the necessary *Peass*-dependencies to build *Peass-CI* afterwards. For installing the develop-branches, execute *buildPeassAndPeassCI-develop.sh*. Always call these scripts from inside an example-folder! For example, inside the *buildOnController*-folder execute *../common/scripts/buildPeassAndPeassCI.sh*.

Before executing another example, don't forget to cleanup the Jenkins workspace! Therefore a script is provided for each example. This will also delete the *peass* and *peass-ci*-folders created inside *common*-folder by *buildPeassAndPeassCI(-develop).sh*. Run the cleanup-scripts with sudo, since the controller-containers are started as user root!

To log in to Jenkins on http://localhost:8080, enter *admin* as user and *123* as password.

### Build testproject on Jenkins controller
This will execute a build on a Jenkins server running inside a Docker container.

* Move to folder *buildOnController*.

* Execute *../common/scripts/buildPeassAndPeassCI.sh* or *../common/scripts/buildPeassAndPeassCI-develop.sh* respectively.

* Execute *buildOnController.sh*. After that, a Docker container named *jenkins_controller* is running.

* After Jenkins is fully started (means http://localhost:8080 can be loaded), you can log in.

* You will see, that a pipeline-project named *buildOnController* is configured and a build is already running.

* If the build is finished, you can check its dashboard. You will find informations about performance changes and their possibly causes.

* You can run *checkResults.sh* afterwards, to check if measurement-results are as expected.

* Running *buildWaitCheckResults.sh* will run all the above steps. So instead of running each single step on its own, you can also execute *buildWaitCheckResults.sh*.

* Clean the workspace of Jenkins controller using *cleanControllerWorkspace.sh*.

### Build testproject in an agent automatically started by Jenkins controller

This will execute a build inside a Jenkins agent. The agent is started by Jenkins controller. The pipeline is configured to pull the Docker image "maven:3.6.3-jdk-11" and use it as build agent.

* Move to folder *buildOnJenkinsStartedAgent*.

* Execute *../common/scripts/buildPeassAndPeassCI.sh* or *../common/scripts/buildPeassAndPeassCI-develop.sh* respectively.

* Execute *buildOnJenkinsStartedAgent.sh*. After that, a Docker container named *jenkins_controller* is running.

* After Jenkins is fully started (means http://localhost:8080 can be loaded), you can log in.

* You will see, that a pipeline-project named *buildOnJenkinsStartedAgent* is configured and a build is already running.

* If the build is finished, you can check its dashboard. You will find informations about performance changes and their possibly causes.

* You can run *checkResults.sh* afterwards, to check if measurement-results are as expected.

* Running *buildWaitCheckResults.sh* will run all the above steps. So instead of running each single step on its own, you can also execute *buildWaitCheckResults.sh*.

* Clean the workspace of Jenkins controller using *cleanControllerWorkspace.sh*.

### Build testproject in a manually registered Jenkins agent
This will execute a build inside a Jenkins agent. Therefore, next to the Docker container for the Jenkins controller, a second one is started and manually registered to Jenkins as build-agent. 

* Move to folder *buildOnManuallyStartedAgent*.

* Execute *../common/scripts/buildPeassAndPeassCI.sh* or *../common/scripts/buildPeassAndPeassCI-develop.sh* respectively.

* Execute *buildOnManuallyStartedAgent.sh*. After that, two Docker containers are running, named *jenkins_controller* and *jenkins_agent-1*.

* Wait until jenkins is fully started (means http://localhost:8080 can be loaded) and log in.

* You will see, that a pipeline-project named *buildOnManuallyStartedAgent* is configured.

* Run *registerAgentToController.sh*. This will register *jenkins_agent-1* as build agent.

* As soon as *jenkins_agent-1* is online in Jenkins, the build will start.

* If the build is finished, you can check its dashboard. You will find informations about performance changes and their possibly causes.

* You can run *checkResults.sh* afterwards, to check if measurement-results are as expected.

* Running *buildWaitCheckResults.sh* will run all the above steps. So instead of running each single step on its own, you can also execute *buildWaitCheckResults.sh*.

* Clean the workspaces of Jenkins controller and agent using *cleanWorkspaces.sh*.
